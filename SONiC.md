## What are switches ?
```text
Switches are devices used in computer networking to connect devices together and allow them to communicate with each other. They operate at the data link layer of the OSI model and are responsible for forwarding data packets between devices on a network. Switches can be managed or unmanaged, and they come in different sizes and configurations depending on the needs of the network.
Switches run on network operating systems (NOSs), which are specialized operating systems designed for network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls.
NOSs can be proprietary or open source, and they are responsible for managing the hardware resources of the switch, as well as providing features such as VLANs, QoS, and security.

Here are some examples of NOSs that switches can run on:
    Stratum Project
    Cumulus Networks
    Big Switch Switch Light
    Open Network Linux
    Dent – Linux Foundation
    PICA8
    Dell Systems

In this diagram, there are multiple switches and routers connected to each other. End devices such as computers, printers, and servers are connected to the switches. The switches are responsible for forwarding data packets between devices on the network. The routers connect different networks together, and they use routing protocols to determine the best path for data to travel.

### SONiC System Architecture
[Need to learn about Monolithic Architecture Microservices Architecture](#info-on-monolithic-architecture-and-microservices-architecture)


    SONiC system's architecture comprises of various modules that interact among each other through a centralized and scalable infrastructure. This infrastructure relies on the use of a redis-database engine: a key-value database to provide a language independent interface, a method for data persistence, replication and multi-process communication among all SONiC subsystems.

    SONiC places each module in independent docker containers to keep high cohesion among semantically-affine components, while reducing coupling between disjointed ones. Each of these components are written to be entirely independent of the platform-specific details required to interact with lower-layer abstractions.



#### SONiC Dockers
    As of today, SONiC breaks its main functional components into the following docker containers:

        Dhcp-relay
        Pmon
        Snmp
        Lldp
        Bgp
        Teamd
        Database
        Swss
        Syncd

    
#### Overview Diagram

#### SONiC Subsystems Description
1. dhcp-relay container: Enables the relay of DHCP requests from a subnet with no DHCP server, to one or
more DHCP servers on other subnets.

2. pmon container: Logs sensor readings from hardware components.
    - fancontrol: Collects fan-related state from the corresponding platform drivers.
    - sensord: Reads and logs sensor readings from hardware components, and alerts when an alarm is triggered.

3. snmp container: Hosts the SNMP features.
    - snmpd: Server that handles incoming SNMP polls from external network elements.
    - snmp_subagent: Inputs the snmpd server with information that is collected from SONiC databases in the centralized Redis engine.

4. lldp container: Hosts LLDP functionality.
    - lldpd: Establishes LLDP connections with external peers to advertise or receive system capabilities.
    - lldpmgrd: Provides incremental-configuration capabilities to LLDP daemon.
    - lldp_syncd: Uploads the discovered state of LLDP to the centralized message infrastructure in the Redis engine. By doing so, the LLDP state is delivered to applications such as SNMP that consume this information.

5. bgp container: Runs the supported routing stacks such as FRR. Although the container is named after the BGP routing protocol, these routing stacks can run various other protocols such as OSPF, IS-IS, LDP, and so on.
    - bgpd: Implements BGP functionality. The routing state from external entities is received through regular TCP/UDP sockets, and pushed to the forwarding plane through the zebra and fpmsyncd interfaces.
    - zebra: Acts as an IP routing manager that provides routing table updates for the kernel, interface-lookups, and route-redistribution services across different protocols. It pushes the computed FIB to kernel through Netlink interface, and to south-bound components involved in the forwarding process through Forwarding Plane Manager (FPM) interface.
    - fpmsyncd: Collects the FIB state that is generated by zebra and dumps its content into the APPL_DB table in the Redis server.

6. teamd container: Allows interaction between [*Link Aggregation functionality (LAG)*](#link-aggregation-functionality) and south-bound subsystems. 
    - teamd: It is a linux-based open-source implementation of LAG protocol.
    - teamsyncd: Pushes the obtained state into the APPL_DB.

7. swss container: Switch State Service (swss) container is a suite of tools to coordinate communication among all the SONiC modules and the Redis engine. It hosts the processes incharge of the north-bound interaction with the SONiC application layer. The exception to this process is the fpmsyncd, teamsyncd and lldp_syncd processes that run within the context of bgp, teamd, and lldp containers respectively.
    - portsyncd: Listens to port-related Netlink events. During bootup, portsyncd obtains physical port information by parsing hardware profile config files. It pushes all the collected state into APPL_DB. Attributes such as port-speeds, lanes and MTU, and also injects the state into the STATE_DB.
    - intfsyncd: Listens to interface-related Netlink events and push collected state into APPL_DB. It handles the attributes such as new and changed ip-addresses that are associated to an interface.
    - neighsyncd: Listens to neighbor-related Netlink events triggered by newly discovered neighbors because of ARP processing. It handles the attributes such as the MAC address and the address family of the neighbor.
    - orchagent: Extracts all the relevant state that is injected by the syncd daemons, processes the information, and pushes data toward the south-bound interface, which is a database within the Redis engine. It operates both as a consumer (state coming from the APPL_DB), and also as a producer (state pushed into ASIC database).
    - intfmgrd: Responds to state arriving from APPL_DB, STATE_DB and CONFIG_DB to configure interfaces in the Linux kernel.
    - vlanmgrd: Responds to state arriving from APPL_DB, STATE_DB and CONFIG_DB to configure VLAN interfaces in the Linux kernel.
    - *database container:** Hosts the database for Redis engine. Databases that are held within this engine are accessible to SONiC applications through a UNIX socket exposed for this purpose by the Redis daemon.

The Redis engine hosts the following main databases:

1. APPL_DB: Stores the state that is generated by all application containers such as routes, next-hops, neighbors, and so on . This database is the south-bound entry point for all applications to interact with other SONiC subsystems.
2. CONFIG_DB: Stores the configuration state that is created by SONiC applications such as port configurations, interfaces, vlans, and so on.
3. STATE_DB: Stores key operational state for entities that are configured in the system. This state is used to resolve dependencies between different SONiC subsystems. For example, a LAG port channel (defined by teamd submodule) can potentially refer to physical ports that may or may not be present in the system.
4. ASIC_DB: Stores the necessary state to drive ASIC configuration and operation.
5. COUNTERS_DB: Stores counters or statistics that are associated to each port in the system.

syncd container: Contains the Switch 
Abstraction Interface (SAI) library. All SAI programming requests are initiated by syncd, usually in response to Redis from various SONiC processes. It is the primary SONiC entry point into platform-specific services. The syncd process programs the networking ASIC through the SAI API. Cisco provides a SAI-friendly implementation of the ASIC SDK. Both the north-bound SAI API and ASIC SDK are coupled into a single shared library that is called the `libsai.so`.

#### CISCO 8000 Switch
The Cisco 8000 switch is a series of routers that deliver service provider-class routing functionality at data center switching density, performance, and power consumption. It is designed to provide high-density, high-performance routing for service providers and large enterprises. 
The Cisco 8000 series routers are available in both fixed and modular form factors to address a wide range of use cases. The modular systems have one or two router processors, multiple line cards, multiple fabric cards, and chassis commons such as fans and power supply units.
The Cisco 8000 switch is used for securely connecting remote industrial operations, delivering peak industrial networking and SD-WAN performance with rugged all-in-one routing and switching, simplifying access networks, converging services with secure and programmable routers, and supporting the application performance required to power services with scalable routing systems.

#### <ins><font color="red"> Docker </font> </ins>
```text
Docker is an open​​ platform for​​ developing, shipping​​, and running​​ applications​.
It enables​​ developers to​​ easily pack, ship​​, and run any​​ application as​​ a lightweight​​, portable, self​​-sufficient container​​ that can run​​ virtually anywhere​.
Here are​​ some reasons​​ why Docker is​​ useful:​
    - Portability: Docker containers are self-contained and can run on any Linux server without dependencies. This makes it easy to move applications between different environments.
    - Efficient use of resources: Docker containers use far less memory than virtual machines, and they start up instantly. They also have their own built-in mechanisms for versioning and component reuse.
    - Easier deployment: Docker makes it easier to put new versions of software with new business features into production quickly and to roll back to a previous version if needed. It also makes it easier to implement strategies like blue/green deployments.
    - Isolation: Docker containers provide isolation and security, allowing you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you don't need to worry about dependencies

```text
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are messaging formats that allow data to be transmitted from one system to another in near real-time.
APIs have become an essential and ubiquitous part of modern software development, from web-based services to mobile apps to IoT devices.
APIs empower developers to leverage the functionality and data of existing services and applications, making it easier and faster to build new software.
APIs are the connective tissue in today's ecosystems, and for companies who know how to implement them, they can cut costs, improve efficiency, and create a great customer experience.
The choice of an API format can have a profound and long-lasting impact on the success and adoption of an API.
APIs streamline the process of digital transformation by enabling applications to track and share data on orders, units produced, product defects, and much more.
The benefits of APIs include integration, scalability, stability, reliability, and security.
By using APIs, organizations can react to supply chain disruption, improve team collaboration, and provide services more efficiently.

#### <ins><font color="red"> Link aggregation functionality </font></ins>
```text
Link aggregation functionality (LAG) is a method of combining multiple network connections in parallel to increase total throughput beyond what a single connection can sustain. It provides redundancy where all but one of the physical links may fail without losing connectivity.
Here are some key points about LAG from the search results:
    - A LAG is a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to aggregate multiple connections at a single endpoint, allowing them to be treated as a single, managed connection.
    - The combined collection of physical ports is called a link aggregation group (LAG).
    - LAGs multiply bandwidth, increase port flexibility, and provide link redundancy between two devices.
    - All the physical links in a given LAG must operate in full-duplex mode at the same speed.
    - The ports in a LAG can be manually configured (static) or automatically configured with LACP enabled.
    - Traffic forwarded to a LAG is load-balanced across the active member ports, achieving an effective bandwidth close to the aggregate bandwidth of all the active member ports of the LAG.
    - A LAG can be used to provide fast and transparent recovery in case one of the individual links fails.
